Lab 2

CIS 3207

This lab was to create a simple shell. I had hoped to implement something involving a linked list to hold each of the 
commands and the appropriate arguments to go along with it. I had a lot of issues getting that to work and eventually
scrapped that plan. I went with a single struct that is allocated and then dellocated for each loop of the command
prompt printing out.

The user input is intitially stored in a temporary string. From there it is passed, along with a struct, to a parser
function where it is parsed and stored in the struct which is then passed to another function to look for the redirect
pipe, or background symbols. From there, one of several different exec() functions is called to deal with the modifier
found. The source code includes a detailed explanation of each function and what it does.

For testing purposes, I manually and programmatically compared the outputs of bash and my shell for several different
commands, and over the last couple days, have used my shell for the development work and daily use of my computer
when I was not met by restrictions in it's abilities. This testing was done on both Apple OS X 10.8 and the LTS
version of 32bit Ubuntu linux.

Unfortunately, time constrains have prevented me from properly debugging file input and pipes before the deadline. I am 
confident that the program (despite being simple) is a good starting point and just needs further debugging of the parser
and calls to open and close the files, but the deadline approached too quickly.

It has just come to my attention that the tar command I used last night mangled the files. This is a second upload of the code
so that it is in a useable state.
