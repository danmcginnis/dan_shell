I have included a makefile with this program. It will create an executable called dan_shell.
Running that program will load the shell. I opted to include all three sections of the lab
into one program. 

The shell can handle normal user interaction: executing commands with and without variables.
The shell also recognizes "exit" as a command that will kill the process.


Unfortunately, my psuedo code was over optomistic and I was unable to implement
the program in the manner that I proposed. This set me back on my time line and I was unable to 
implement all the features properly.

The functionality is in place for all the features, but currently I have not been able to debug input
from a file or pipes.
